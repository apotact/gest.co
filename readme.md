### Setup

Server is set up with a prime and hub repo as outlined at
http://joemaller.com/990/a-web-focused-git-workflow/

compile, minify etc, all source files into the `dist` folder. then `gulp deploy`
will push these changes to the server

may need to clone the remote repo into `dist` before deploying, maybe do this
through gulp
