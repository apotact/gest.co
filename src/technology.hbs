        The San Francisco Bay Area faces a housing crisis.  With far more people
        wanting to live here than there are homes, rents have risen to record
        heights.  However, building new housing isn't easy, with concerns about
        traffic, views, gentrification, and open space, to name just a few.
        Still, the problem can be solved, though not by San Francisco alone.
        You'll have to plan and build regionally.
